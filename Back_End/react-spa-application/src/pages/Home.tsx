                <p>React is an open-source JavaScript library created by Facebook to build dynamic user interfaces.
                    It allows developers to build reusable components, manage state efficiently, and create lightning-fast single-page applications.
                    React is widely used by companies like Meta, Netflix, Amazon, Airbnb, and Flipkart.</p>
